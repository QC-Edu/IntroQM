# Final Exam

## Rules and Guidelines
**You must submit your Jupyter notebooks for Part 1 and Part 2 at least 48 hours prior to your appointment for Part 3.** You will be given your grade on Part 1 and Part 2 before the oral exam, so that you know what your status is. *For late submission of Part 1 and/or Part 2, I will deduct 2 points per hour.

&#x1f4d6; **Rules for "Open Book" Exam:**
**Like all other portions of this exam, this part of the exam is open notes and open library. It is "open internet search" but you (obviously!) can't post questions on an internet discussion board or homework/problem/exam help site. You are not allowed to communicate with your classmates or any other human being (except me) about these questions or your responses, and this includes human beings (singular or plural, known or anonymous) online.**

## Part 1 (30%-40%; Jupyter)
Part one of the exam has 20 questions (2 points each) and 2 bonus questions (2 points each). **You must submit it at least 48 hours prior to your oral defense/exam.**

You can find Part 1 of the exam online [], at [syzygy], or on [binder]. If you look on binder, look for the file . External to McMaster, you can use this alternative [syzygy link].

## Part 2 (30%-40%; Jupyter)
Part 2 of the exam will be posted soon. **You must submit it at least 48 hours prior to your oral defense/exam.**

## Part 3 (20%-40%; oral)
Part 3 of the exam is an oral exam. It will take about 30 minutes. It has three parts.
- I will ask you questions about your responses in Part 1. I will score this as "plus" "minus" or "neutral", and adjust your grade on Part 1 up or down at most 10 points based on this portion of the exam.
- I will ask you questions about your responses in Part 2. I will score this as "plus" "minus" or "neutral", and adjust your grade on Part 2 up or down at most 10 points based on this portion of the exam.
- For each of the 4 question groupings listed in the [notebook], I will pick one question at random. Each of these questions is worth up to 5 points. You can find an html version of the notebook [here](notes/html/Final%20Exam%20Part%203.html). 



This [Jupyter notebook](../ipynb/IntroQM2021.ipynb) has problems related to the fundamentals of quantum mechanics. You can also access this notebook at [syzygy](https://mcmaster.syzygy.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FPaulWAyers%2FIntroQChemProblems&urlpath=tree%2FIntroQChemProblems%2Fipynb%2FIntroQM2021.ipynb&branch=main&depth=1) or on [binder](https://hub.gke2.mybinder.org/user/paulwayers-introqchemproblems-ax9n28q6/notebooks/ipynb/IntroQM2021.ipynb). External to McMaster, you can use binder or this alternative [syzygy link](https://pims.syzygy.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FPaulWAyers%2FIntroQChemProblems&urlpath=tree%2FIntroQChemProblems%2Fipynb%2FIntroQM2021.ipynb&branch=main&depth=1). 

Sometimes the above links for syzygy and/or binder may fail because you have existing files in your directory that conflict with the files that are being downloaded and `nbgitpuller` can't figure out how to merge the disparate copies. In this case, possible solutions are:
1. Using one of the following links, you can [directly](../ipynb/IntroQM2021.ipynb) <a href="../ipynb/IntroQM2021.ipynb" download>download</a> the file to the default location on your computer for downloaded files. However, one or both of these links may not work with all browsers depending on your security settings. You can also open the [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/PaulWAyers/IntroQChemProblems/blob/main/ipynb/IntroQM2021.ipynb?raw=true) in your browser. On most machines and with most browsers, the above link will give you a raw JSON file that looks really nasty, but if you save it, it will be a well-formatted Jupyter notebook. You can also go to the "pretty" version of the [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/PaulWAyers/IntroQChemProblems/blob/main/ipynb/IntroQM2021.ipynb), right-click on the "raw" button, and select "Save As" to download the file. Finally, after the file is downloaded, you can then open this file using [mcmaster.syzygy.ca](https://mcmaster.syzygy.ca/) or [pims.syzygy.ca](https://pims.syzygy.ca/), or any other (e.g., local) installation of Jupyter.
2. Manually pull in the file you want directly from Github. There are instructions about how to do this on the syzygy web site.
3. Keep a directory with the "raw" files I post online, and then a "working" directory with the files you use. You can automatically download files into a reference directory by using the links for [McMaster](https://mcmaster.syzygy.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FPaulWAyers%2FIntroQChemProblems&urlpath=tree%2FIntroQChemProblems%2Fipynb%2FIntroQM2021.ipynb&branch=main&targetPath=raw) or [elsewhere](https://pims.syzygy.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FPaulWAyers%2FIntroQChemProblems&urlpath=tree%2FIntroQChemProblems%2Fipynb%2FIntroQM2021.ipynb&branch=main&targetPath=raw).
