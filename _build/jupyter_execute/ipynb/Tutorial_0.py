# # Python _and_ GitHub fundamentals
# 
# 
# Hello Folks! In this tutorial we are going to cover basics steps of __editing__, __submiting__ and __analyzing__ our results using GitHub environment along with basics python skills.

# ## Receive the assignments
# 
# 
# This moked assignment is available via the [link](https://classroom.github.com/a/8eHJCZ35). Accept the assignment, as described in [GitHub fundamentals](https://qc-edu.github.io/IntroQM2022/ipynb/ghfundamentals.html)
# ![p1](pics_t0/1.png)
# 
# Now you can see a created repository with the task ![p1](pics_t0/2.png)
# There is only one file --jupyter notebook (_\*.ipynb file_)-- that you need to complete in order to have your assignment done. 
# 
# In the current repo this file is called **Schr&ouml;dinger.ipynb**

# ## Editing file
# 
# There are several ways to edit .ipynb file:
# 1. Using [Binder](https://mybinder.org/)
# 2. Using [Jupyter Notebook](https://docs.anaconda.com/ae-notebooks/user-guide/basic-tasks/apps/jupyter/index.html) through [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) package
# 3. Using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
# 
# In this tutorial we will cover the how to work with jupyter notebooks through google colab.
# For doing this you need to download the .zip archive of the repo. In order to download it click `code` and `Download Zip` ![p4](pics_t0/3.png)
# 
# When repo is downloaded you need to go to to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and add there .ipynb file from the repo: `File` $\rightarrow$ `Upload notebook` ![p5](pics_t0/4.png)
# Upload **Schrodinger.ipynb** file 
# 
# Voila! ![p6](pics_t0/5.png)
# 
# ## Understanding the assignment
# There is an instruction written in the notebook. All you need to do is to fill the code between 
# ```
# ### START YOUR CODE HERE
# ...
# ### END YOUR CODE HERE
# ```
# Let's say I'm sensetive enough to assume that cat is 100% alive:
# ![p6](pics_t0/6.png)
# 
# Now, we can save and download edited notebook: click `File` $\rightarrow$ `Save` and then `Download` $\rightarrow$ `Download .ipynb`
# ![p7](pics_t0/7.png)
# 
# 
# ## Submitting an assignment
# 
# Submitting the assignment is breeze!
# When you downloaded the final version of the file just go to your repo and click `Add file` $\rightarrow$ `Upload files` and upload recently created file ![p9](pics_t0/9.png)
# Now commit your changes and click `Commit changes` ![p10](pics_t0/10.png)
# 
# 
# ## Check the result
# 
# In order to check whether your code passed tests all you need to do is go to `Actions`$\rightarrow$ `Your commit` $\rightarrow$ `Test with pytest`. ![p11](pics_t0/11.png)
# 
# 
# Ooops.... red cross indicates that there is something wrong. Let's try again.
# 
# Open Google Colab and now let's say that cat is alive _and_ dead simultaneously:
# ![p12](pics_t0/12.png)
# 
# If you can see green check mark - ***CONGRATULATIONS!*** you passed the assignment
# 
# 
# Upload and commit new notebook and check if it passed the test:
# ![p14](pics_t0/14.png)
# 
# 
# Well done! We nailed it and now it's finally a time to reward yourself scrolling Tik Tok
# 
# 
# 
# __Nota Bene__
# In case you can't pass the test click at the commit name (`Wrong answer` in this particular case) and then contact me `@RichRick1`at the comment section
