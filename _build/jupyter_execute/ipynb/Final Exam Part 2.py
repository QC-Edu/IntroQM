# 
# ## The 1-dimensional Harmonic Oscillator
# ### Motivation: Nuclear Schr&ouml;dinger Equation for a Diatomic Molecule
# The nuclear Schr&ouml;dinger equation for a diatomic molecule is
# 
# $$
# \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2M_1}\nabla^2_1 -\frac{\hbar^2}{2M_2}\nabla^2_2 + E_{\text{electronic}}(\mathbf{R}_1,\mathbf{R}_2)\right) \chi(\mathbf{R}_1,\mathbf{R}_2) = E_{\text{total}}\chi(\mathbf{R}_1,\mathbf{R}_2)
# $$
# 
# The potential energy surface on which the nuclei move, $E_{\text{electronic}}\left(\mathbf{R}_1,\mathbf{R}_2\right)$, depends only on the separation between the molecules, 
# 
# $$
# E_{\text{electronic}}\left(\mathbf{R}_1,\mathbf{R}_2\right) = V\left( \left|\mathbf{R}_1 - \mathbf{R}_2 \right| \right)
# $$
# 
# This suggests changing coordinates using the [center of mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass). Specifically, we define a coordinate that describes the position of the center of mass
# 
# $$
# \mathbf{R} = \frac{M_1 \mathbf{R}_1 + M_2\mathbf{R}_2}{M_1 + M_2}
# $$
# 
# and a coordinate that describes the internuclear position
# 
# $$
# \mathbf{u} = \mathbf{R}_2 - \mathbf{R}_1
# $$
# 
# To rewrite the Hamiltonian in this new coordinate system, we need to rewrite the kinetic energy in the new coordinates. To do this, notice that differentiation with respect to the old (Cartesian) coordinates of the nuclei can be re-expressed in the new coordinates as:
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
# \frac{df}{dX_1} &= \frac{df}{du_x}\frac{du_x}{dX_1} + \frac{df}{dR_x}\frac{dR_x}{dX_1} \\
# &= -\frac{df}{du_x} + \frac{M_1}{M_1+M_2}\frac{df}{dR_x} \\
# \frac{df}{dX_2} &= \frac{df}{du_x}\frac{du_x}{dX_2} + \frac{df}{dR_x}\frac{dR_x}{dX_2} \\
# &= \frac{df}{du_x} + \frac{M_2}{M_1+M_2}\frac{df}{dR_x}
# \end{align}
# $$
# 
# So the momentum operators for the nuclei can be written as:
# 
# $$
# \hat{\mathbf{p}}_1 = -\hat{\mathbf{p}}_u + \frac{M_1}{M_1+M_2}\hat{\mathbf{p}}_R \\
# \hat{\mathbf{p}}_2 = \hat{\mathbf{p}}_u + \frac{M_2}{M_1+M_2}\hat{\mathbf{p}}_R
# $$
# 
# and the kinetic energy operators are
# 
# $$
# \frac{\hat{\mathbf{p}}_1^2}{2M_1} = \frac{\hat{\mathbf{p}}_u^2}{2M_1} + \frac{M_1\hat{\mathbf{p}}_R^2}{2(M_1+M_2)^2} \\
# \frac{\hat{\mathbf{p}}_2^2}{2M_1} = \frac{\hat{\mathbf{p}}_u^2}{2M_2} + \frac{M_2\hat{\mathbf{p}}_R^2}{2(M_1+M_2)^2}
# $$
# 
# Adding together these expressions gives the Schr&ouml;dinger equation in the new coordinate system,
# 
# $$
# \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \left(\frac{1}{M_1} + \frac{1}{M_2} \right) \nabla^2_u 
#       -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \left(\frac{1}{M_1 + M_2} \right)\nabla^2_R 
#       + V(u) \right) \chi(\mathbf{R},\mathbf{u}) = E_{\text{total}}\chi(\mathbf{R},\mathbf{u})
# $$
# 
# or, introducing the reduced mass 
# 
# $$
# \mu = \frac{M_1 M_2}{M_1 + M_2} = \left(\frac{1}{M_1} + \frac{1}{M_2} \right)^{-1} \\
# $$
# 
# and total mass
# 
# $$
# M = M_1 + M_2
# $$
# 
# 
# $$
# \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2 \mu}-\frac{\hbar^2}{2M}\nabla^2_R + V(u) \right) \chi(\mathbf{R},\mathbf{u}) = E_{\text{total}}\chi(\mathbf{R},\mathbf{u})
# $$
# 
# This Schr&ouml;dinger equation can be solved by separation of variables. The Schr&ouml;dinger equation for the center of mass represents the translational motion of the molecule; in the absence of a potential confining the molecule, this is just the Schr&ouml;dinger equation for a free particle,
# 
# $$
# -\frac{\hbar^2}{2M}\nabla^2_R \eta(\mathbf{R}) = E \eta(\mathbf{R}) 
# $$
# 
# This contributes nothing to the energy if we assume the molecule is not moving (so that it's kinetic energy is zero). If the molecule were confined, that confining potential would be inserted here. 
# 
# The Schr&ouml;dinger equation for the internuclear coordinate represents the rotations and vibrations of the molecule:
# 
# $$
# \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2 \mu} + V(u) \right) \varphi(\mathbf{u}) = E_{\text{rovib}}\varphi(\mathbf{u})
# $$
# 
# The Hamiltonian in this equation is typically called the rovibrational Hamiltonian; its energy is the rovibrational energy. Because the potential energy depends only on the internuclear distance, the system is spherically symmetric. Separating out the angular dependence in the usual way,
# 
# $$
# \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2\mu} \left( \frac{d^2}{du^2}
# + \frac{2}{u} \frac{d}{du}\right) 
#       + \frac{\hat{L}^2(\theta_u,\phi_u)}{2\mu u^2} + V(u) \right)
#       \varphi_{k,J,M_J}(u,\theta_u,\phi_u) 
# = E_{k,J,M_J}\varphi_{k,J,M_J}(u,\theta_u,\phi_u)
# $$
# 
# Recall that $\hat{L}^2$ is the angular momentum squared, and its eigenfunctions are the spherical harmonics, which we have chosen to denote with a different quantum number to avoid confusion with the electronic problem,
# 
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
# \hat{L}^2 Y_J^{M_J}(\theta_u,\phi_u) = \hbar^2 J(J+1) Y_J^{M_J}(\theta_u,\phi_u) \qquad \qquad J&=0,1,2,\ldots \\ M_J &= 0,\pm 1,\ldots\,\pm J
# \end{align}
# $$
# The exact wavefunction is therefore the product of a radial wavefunction and a spherical harmonic, 
# 
# $$
# \varphi_{k,J,M_J}(u,\theta_u,\phi_u) = R_k(u)  Y_J^{M_J}(\theta_u,\phi_u)
# $$
# 
# where the radial wavefunction and the rovibrational energy are obtained by solving
# 
# $$
# \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2\mu} \left( \frac{d^2}{du^2}
# + \frac{2}{u} \frac{d}{du}\right) 
#       + \frac{\hbar^2 J(J+1)}{2\mu u^2} + V(u) \right)
#       R_{k}(u) = E_{k,J}R_{k}(u)
# $$
# 

# ### Quadratic Approximation to the Potential Energy Curve and the Rigid Rotor Approximation
# The potential energy of a diatomic molecule goes to infinity at short internuclear separation ($u \rightarrow 0$) because of the nuclear-nuclear repulsion and approaches a constant (which we typically define to be zero) at infinite internuclear distance. In between these limits, there is typically a minimum at $r_e$, which represents the equilibrium bond length for the molecule (in the absence of quantum effects). If we assume that the atomic nuclei, which are much more massive than electrons, have relatively small De Broglie wavelength and do not deviate far from $u = r_e$, it is reasonable to expand the potential energy in a Taylor series about that point,
# $$
# V(u) = V(r_e) + V'(r_e)(u-r_e) + \tfrac{1}{2!}V''(r_e)(u - r_e)^2 + \cdots
# $$
# Because we are expanding around the minimum, $V'(r_e) = 0$. The term $V(r_e)$ only shifts the total energy of the system up or down by a constant, so we can *choose* to set the zero of the energy scale so that $V(r_e) = 0$. Neglecting higher-order terms in the expansion, which we hope will be small, we can then write
# $$
# \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2\mu} \left( \frac{d^2}{du^2}
# + \frac{2}{u} \frac{d}{du}\right) 
#       + \frac{\hbar^2 J(J+1)}{2\mu u^2} + \tfrac{1}{2}V''(r_e)(u-r_e)^2 \right)
#       R_{k}(u) = E_{k,J}R_{k}(u)
# $$
# The rotational contribution can also be simplified by taking a Taylor series:
# $$
# \frac{\hbar^2}{2\mu u^2}u^-2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{2\mu r_e^2} - \frac{2\hbar^2}{2\mu r_e^3}(u - r_e) + \cdots  
# $$
# The first and higher-order terms in the series represent centrifugal distortion, which indicates that a molecule rotates faster and faster, larger bond lengths are favored. Such effects are usually small for low-energy vibrational states of strong bonds, where it is reasonable to make a [*rigid rotor approximation*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_rotor#Quantum_mechanical_rigid_rotor) and truncate the Taylor series after the zeroth order term. The rotational and vibrational problems then decouple, with the rotational wavefunctions and energies being given by:
# $$
# \frac{\hat{L}^2}{2\mu r_e^2} Y_J^{M_J}(\theta_u,\phi_u) = \frac{\hbar^2 J(J+1)}{2 \mu r_e^2}      Y_J^{M_J}(\theta_u,\phi_u)
# $$
# and the vibrational Hamiltonian is then approximated as a [quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_harmonic_oscillator):
# $$
# \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2\mu} \left( \frac{d^2}{du^2}
# + \frac{2}{u} \frac{d}{du}\right) + \tfrac{1}{2}V''(r_e)(u-r_e)^2 \right)
#       R_{k}(u) = E_{k}R_{k}(u)
# $$

# ### The Harmonic Oscillator Hamiltonian
# ![harmonic oscillator wf](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/HarmOsziFunktionen.png "The Harmonic Oscillator wavefunctions and energy levels. CC-SA3 by AllenMcC")
# 
# It is convenient to change the coordinates in this problem, so that the dependence on $r_e$ is not explicit. Defining 
# $$
# x = u - r_e \\
# \kappa_e = V''(r_e)
# $$
# the harmonic-oscillator Hamiltonian becomes:
# $$
# \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2\mu} \left( \frac{d^2}{dx^2}
# + \frac{2}{u} \frac{d}{dx}\right) + \tfrac{1}{2}\kappa_e x^2 \right)
#       R_{k}(x) = E_{k,J}R_{k}(x)
# $$
# In the picture of a diatomic molecule where the atoms are connected to each other with a harmonic spring $x$ is the deviation of the spring from its equilibrium length and $\kappa_e$ is the force constant for the spring. The angular frequency for the spring is
# $$
# \omega = \sqrt{\frac{\kappa_e}{\mu}}
# $$
# and the reduced mass is defined as previously,
# $$
# \mu = \frac{M_1 M_2}{M_1 + M_2}
# $$

# ### Solutions to the Harmonic Oscillator Hamiltonian
# We will not attempt to solve the harmonic oscillator Schr&ouml;dinger equation. It suffices to note that the equation *is* exactly solvable using techniques similar to those we've used for other systems, and that the solution is written in terms of (yet another) type of special function, the [Hermite polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermite_polynomials):
# 
# \begin{align}
# H_0(y) &= 1 \\
# H_1(y) &= 2y \\
# H_2(y) &= 4y^2 - 2 \\
# H_3(y) &= 8y^3 - 12 \\
# H_n(y) &= 2y H_{n-1}(y) - 2(n-1)H_{n-2}(y)
# \end{align}
# 
# As with the associated Laguerre polynomials, one must be careful because there are (at least) two different definitions of the Hermite polynomials that are prevalent in the literature. These are the-called [physicist's Hermite polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermite_polynomials#Definition). Specifically, we have:
# $$
# R_k(x) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2^k k!}}\left(\frac{\mu \omega}{\pi \hbar} \right)^{\frac{1}{4}}H_k\left(x\sqrt{\frac{\mu \omega}{\hbar}}\right) \exp \left[-\frac{1}{2} \left(x\sqrt{\frac{\mu \omega}{\hbar}}\right)^2  \right]
# $$
# and the corresponding eigenvalues are
# $$
# E_k = \hbar \omega \left( k+ \tfrac{1}{2} \right) = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{\kappa_e}{\mu}} \left( k+ \tfrac{1}{2} \right) \qquad \qquad k=0,1,2,\ldots
# $$

# ### &#x1F5A9; Isotope Effects in Vibrational Spectroscopy (8 pts)
# For a diatomic molecule that is well-described by a harmonic oscillator, allowed vibrational transitions correspond to $\Delta k = \pm 1$. 
# 
# - A measurement informs you that the fundamental vibrational transition associated with $k=0$ to $k=1$ in ${}^7\text{Li}{}^{7}\text{Li}$ (note the isotope labels) is characterized by $\tilde{\nu} = \tfrac{1}{\lambda} = 351.43 \text{ cm}^{-1}$. **What is the force constant, $\kappa_e$, for the Lithium dimer in Newton/meter?** 
# - Assume that ${}^6\text{Li}{}^{6}\text{Li}$ molecule has the same force constant. **What is the wavenumber of the $k=0$ to $k=1$ transition of ${}^6\text{Li}{}^{6}\text{Li}$ in $\text{cm}^{-1}$?**

# ![Morse Potential](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Morse-potential.png/650px-Morse-potential.png "The Morse Potential, CC-SA3 by Somoza")
# ## The Morse Oscillator
# 
# ### Motivation
# The harmonic oscillator is not very realistic for two reasons
# - it predicts that negative bond lengths would be possible, since the potential energy curve does not diverge to infinity as $u \rightarrow 0$.
# - it predicts that chemical bonds never break, since the potential energy curve does not approach an asymptotic constant as $u \rightarrow \infty$. 
# 
# The last issue, which is the more severe one from the standpoint of qualitative chemical behavior, can be remedied by replacing the harmonic oscillator potential with the Morse potential,

# V_{\text{Morse}}(u) = D_e \left(1 - e^{-a(u-r_e)} \right)^2
# $$
# Here $D_e$ is the dissociation constant (the energy it takes to break the bond between the atoms) and $a$ is related to the force constant by
# $$
# a = \sqrt{\frac{\kappa_e}{2D_e}}
# $$
# Recall that 
# $$
# \kappa_e = V''_{\text{Morse}}(r_e)

# ### Solution
# The Schr&ouml;dinger equation for the Morse potential, 
# $$
# \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2\mu} \left( \frac{d^2}{du^2}
# + \frac{2}{u} \frac{d}{du}\right) + V_{\text{Morse}}(u) \right)
#       \phi_{k}(u) = E_{k}\phi_{k}(u)
# $$
# can also be solved exactly. The eigenfunctions are [quite complicated functions of the associated Laguerre polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_potential#Vibrational_states_and_energies) but the energies have a relatively simple expression,
# $$
# E_k = \hbar \omega_0 \left(k+\tfrac{1}{2}\right) - \frac{\left[ \hbar \omega_0 \left(k+\tfrac{1}{2}\right) \right]^2}{4 D_e}
# \qquad \qquad k=0,1,2,\ldots,k_{\max}
# $$
# where, just as in the harmonic oscillator, 
# $$
# \omega_0 = a \sqrt{\frac{2D_e}{\mu}} = \sqrt{\frac{\kappa_e}{\mu}}
# $$
# Unlike the harmonic oscillator, only a $k_{\max} < \infty$ states can be bound by the Morse potential, where
# $$
# k_{\max} = \left\lfloor \frac{2D_e}{\hbar \omega_0} - \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor
# $$
# Here $\lfloor x \rfloor$ denotes the integer part of $x$. E.g., $\lfloor 20.3 \rfloor = 20$. The upshot of the equation for $k_{\max}$ is that the Morse oscillator has about twice as many states with energy less than $D_e$ as the harmonic oscillator does, because the states of the Morse oscillator become closer and closer together as the molecule gets closer to dissociation. The ability to have only a finite number of bound vibrational states is one way in which the Morse oscillator is more like a real vibrating molecule than the harmonic oscillator.

# YOUR ANSWER HERE

# ## Vibrating Diatomic Molecules  in an External Field
# ### Motivation
# For polar diatomic molecules, their dipole moment may be approximated as: 
# $$
# \mathbf{p} = q \left(\mathbf{R}_2 - \mathbf{R}_1 \right)
# $$
# where $q$ is the magnitude of the charges on the atoms and $\mathbf{R}_2$ is the positively charged atom. The energy of a polar diatomic molecule interacting with an electric field is then
# $$
# V_{\text{dipole}} = -\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{E}
# $$
# This energy is minimized when the dipole aligns in the field, giving an energy lowering that is proportional to the product of the magnitude of the dipole moment and the electric field strength,
# $$
# V_{\text{dipole}} = -|\mathbf{p}| |\mathbf{E}| = - q u F
# $$
# where $q$ is the atomic charge, $u$ is the internuclear distance, and F is the field strength. This is a quite simple model, and neglects the following 
# - atomic charges change when the bond length changes
# - atoms are not simply point charges
# - a molecule's electrons rearrange in response to the electric field. To a first approximation, this means that the atomic charges change in the presence of the field.
# 
# Nonetheless, this model does capture some key features, notably the fact that in the presence of a uniform external field, the bond in a polar diatomic molecule tends to elongate. 
# 
# ### Hamiltonian for a Polar Diatomic Molecule in an External Uniform Electric Field
# The Hamiltonian for a vibrating molecule in an electric field can then be approximated as
# $$
# \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2\mu} \left( \frac{d^2}{du^2}
# + \frac{2}{u} \frac{d}{du}\right) + V(u) - q_e u F \right)
#       R_{k}(u) = E_{k}R_{k}(u)
# $$
# where $q_e$ is magnitude of the atomic charge for $u = r_e$. If the equilibrium dipole moment of the molecule is known, then 
# $$
# q_e = \frac{\left[\text{dipole moment in Debye}\right] \cdot 3.33564 \cdot 10^{-30} \text{ C/m}}{\text{bond length in meters}} \text{ Coulombs}
# $$
# or, in terms of the charge on the electron $e$, 
# $$
# q_e = \frac{\left[\text{dipole moment in Debye}\right] \cdot 2.08919 \cdot 10^{-11} e/\text{m}}{\text{bond length in meters}} e
# $$
# 
# The most interesting effects are not those that are associated with the classical interaction energy of the dipole with the field, we usually subtract that energy from the Hamiltonian, so that we only see the change in the molecule's energy that was *induced* by the field. I.e., we usually focus on the vibrational dipole polarization energy,
# $$
# E_k^{(\text{polarization})}(F) = E_k(F) - \left[ E_k(F=0) - q_e r_e F \right]
# $$
# The vibrational dipole polarization energy can be computed from the shifted Schr&ouml;dinger equation, 
# where
# 
# \begin{align}
# \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2\mu} \left( \frac{d^2}{du^2}
# + \frac{2}{u} \frac{d}{du}\right) + V(u) - q_e (u-r_e) F \right)
#       \psi_{k}(u) &= \left(E_k(F=0) + E_{k}^{(\text{polarization})}(F)\right)\psi_{k}(u) \\
#       &= E_{k}^{(\text{shifted})}(F)\psi_{k}(u) 
# \end{align}
# 
# where we have (re)defined the energy as
# $$
# E_k^{(\text{shifted})}(F) = E_k(0) + E_k^{(\text{polarization})}(F)
# $$
# 
# The total energy of the vibrating diatomic molecule can then be expressed as:
# $$
# E_k(F) = E_k(0) - q_e r_e F + E_k^{(\text{polarization})}(F)
# $$
# If one expands the vibrational polarization energy in a Taylor series, 
# $$
# E_k^{(\text{polarization})}(F) = -\tfrac{1}{2} \alpha_{\text{vib}} F^2 - \tfrac{1}{3!} \beta_{\text{vib}} F^3 - \tfrac{1}{4!} \gamma_{\text{vib}} F^3 + \cdots
# $$
# where $\alpha_{\text{vib}}$ is the vibrational contribution to the dipole polarizability (subject to the approximations mentioned above) and the higher-order coefficients are the first-, $\beta$, and higher-order vibrational dipole hyperpolarizabilities.
# 

# ### The Harmonic Oscillator in a Uniform External Electric Field
# To model a diatomic molecule vibrating in a uniform electric field, we need to choose a practical model for the vibrational potential energy function, $V(u)$. The simplest possible model is to use a Harmonic Oscillator, which leads to the Hamiltonian:
# $$
# \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2\mu} \left( \frac{d^2}{du^2}
# + \frac{2}{u} \frac{d}{du}\right) + \tfrac{1}{2}\kappa_e(u-r_e)^2 - q_e (u-r_e) F \right)
#       R_{k}(u) = E_{k}^{\text{shifted}}(F) R_{k}(u)
# $$
# 
# #### Sketch of Perturbative Approach
# One could treat this Hamiltonian with perturbation theory. By construction, $E_k^{(\text{shifted})}$ does not depend on the field to first order. Therefore, the leading-order term is the second-order contribution,
# $$
# \left[\frac{d^2 E_k}{dF^2}\right]_{F=0}
# =\left[\frac{d^2E_k^{(\text{polarization})}}{dF^2}\right]_{F=0}=\left[\frac{d^2E_k^{(\text{shifted})}}{dF^2}\right]_{F=0} = 2q_e \sum_{j=0\\j \ne k}^{\infty}\frac{ \left|\langle R_j(0) | u-r_e |R_k(0) \rangle \right|^2}{E_k(F=0) - E_j(F=0)} 
# $$
# 
# Evaluating this expression is feasible because the integrals that one needs,
# $$
# V_{kl} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} R_k(u)(u-r_e) R_l(u) du 
# $$
# have a simple explicit formulae. Specifically,
# $$
# V_{kl} = 
# \begin{cases}
# \sqrt{\frac{k}{2}}   & k=l+1 \\
# \sqrt{\frac{k+1}{2}} & k=l-1 \\
# 0  & \text{otherwise}
# \end{cases}
# $$
# 
# 
# #### Exact Solution by Completing the Square
# While a perturbative approach is possible, the harmonic oscillator in a uniform external electric field can be solved exactly. [Completing the square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completing_the_square) on the potential,
# $$
# \tfrac{1}{2}\kappa_e(u-r_e)^2 - q_e (u-r_e) F = \tfrac{1}{2}\kappa_e\left(u - r_e - \frac{qF}{\kappa_e}\right)^2 - \frac{q^2F^2}{2 \kappa_e}
# $$
# The force constant in this new shifted harmonic oscillator is the still $\kappa_e$, but the bond length 
# $$
# r_e(F) = r_e + \frac{qF}{\kappa_e}
# $$
# and the energies
# $$
# E_k^{\text{shifted}}(F) = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{\kappa_e}{\mu}}\left(k+\frac{1}{2}\right) - \frac{q^2F^2}{2 \kappa_e}
# $$
# have chagned. Referring to the definitions above, the vibrational polarization energy is:
# $$
# E_k^{\text{polarization}}(F) = - \frac{q^2}{2 \kappa_e}F^2
# $$
# the vibrational polarizability is
# $$
# \alpha_{\text{vib}} = \frac{q^2}{\kappa_e}
# $$
# and the total vibrational energy of the diatomic molecule in the field
# $$
# E_k(F) = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{\kappa_e}{\mu}}\left(k+\frac{1}{2}\right) - q r_e F- \frac{q^2}{2 \kappa_e}F^2

# YOUR ANSWER HERE

# ### The Morse Oscillator in an External Electric Field
# Instead of using a harmonic oscillator to describe the vibrational motion of a polar diatomic molecule, one could use the Morse Oscillator. In this case, the Schr&ouml;dinger equation is:
# 
# \begin{align}
# \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2\mu} \left( \frac{d^2}{du^2}
# + \frac{2}{u} \frac{d}{du}\right) + V_{\text{Morse}}(u) - q_e (u-r_e) F \right)
#       \phi_{k}(u) &= \left(E_k(F=0) + E_{k}^{(\text{polarization})}(F)\right)\phi_{k}(u) \\
#       &= E_{k}^{(\text{shifted})}(F)\phi_{k}(u) 
# \end{align}
# 
# Unlike the harmonic oscillator in an electric field, it is no longer possible to solve this system exactly. However, there are many possible ways to approximate the energy of a Morse oscillator in a uniform electric field, among them:
# - Use the harmonic-oscillator in an external field as a zeroth-order Hamiltonian, and use perturbation theory to estimate the change in energy associated with using the Morse potential instead.
# - Use the eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator in an electric field as a basis; expand the eigenfunctions of the Morse potential in an electric field in this basis.
# - Use the Morse potential without an electric field as a zeroth-order Hamiltonian; use perturbation theory to estimate the effects of the electric field.
# - Use the eigenfunctions of the Morse potential without an electric field as a basis; expand the eigenfunctions of the Morse potential in an electric field in this basis.
# 
# The first two approaches are arguably preferable mathematically, but the latter two are easier. This is because the matrix elements for the Morse potential in an electric field, 
# $$
# V_{mn} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \phi_m(u;F=0) (u - r_e) \phi_n(u;F=0) du 
# $$
# are (relatively) easy to evaluate. Specifically we have:
# $$
# V_{m<n} = \frac{-1^{m-n+1}}{a(n-m)(2\lambda-n-m-1)}\left[\frac{n! \Gamma(2\lambda - n)(2\lambda - 2n - 1)(2\lambda - 2m - 1)}{m! \Gamma(2\lambda - m)} \right]^{\frac{1}{2}}
# $$
# In practice, this equation is numerically ill-conditioned when $m$, $n$, or $\lambda$ is large, because then some of the terms are gigantic. It is reasonable to cut off the expansion for large $m$ and large $n$; when $\lambda$ is large, one can use the Ramanujan expression for the $\Gamma$ function,
# $$
# \Gamma(y) = \sqrt{\pi} \left(\frac{y-1}{e} \right)^{y-1} \left(8(y-1)^3 + 4(y-1)^2 + (y-1) + \frac{1}{30} \right)^{\frac{1}{6}}
# $$
# to evaluate the square root of the ratio of the $\Gamma$ functions directly
# $$
# \frac{\Gamma(y)}{\Gamma(x)} = \left(\sqrt{\frac{y-1}{x-1}}\right)^{y-1} \left(\sqrt{\frac{e}{x-1}} \right)^{x-y}
# \left(\frac{8(y-1)^3 + 4(y-1)^2 + (y-1) + \frac{1}{30}}{8(x-1)^3 + 4(x-1)^2 + (x-1) + \frac{1}{30}}\right)^{\frac{1}{12}}
# $$
# The code below actually uses the (more complicted) Stirling expansion, because in practice it seemed more accurate.
# 
# The diagonal elements are:
# $$
# V_{mm} \approx \frac{\frac{3}{2} + 3m + \frac{13/12 + (7/2)(m^2+m)}{2 \lambda} + \frac{(m+1)^4}{4\lambda^2}}{2\lambda a}
# $$
# In these expressions, 
# $$
# \lambda = \frac{\sqrt{2 \mu D_e}}{a \hbar}
# $$
# Using the aforementioned definition of $a$,
# $$
# a = \sqrt{\frac{\kappa_e}{2D_e}}
# $$
# this simplifies to
# $$
# \lambda = \frac{2 D_e}{\hbar}\frac{\mu}{\kappa_e} = \frac{2 D_e}{\hbar \omega_0} 
# $$
# > Note. Technically in both perturbation theory and in a variational approach one would need to consider the continuum states, corresponding to the states of the dissociated diatomic molecule. We are neglecting that tricky business here, but that is the main reason that an approach starting from the harmonic oscillator is mathematically preferable.
# 
# > Note. The choice of $u = |\mathbf{R}_1 - \mathbf{R}_2|$ or $u = |\mathbf{R}_2 - \mathbf{R}_1|$ is arbitrary. This means, in practice, that whether one chooses a field oriented in the $+u$ or $-u$ direction is arbitrary. One should compute both choices, and pick the one which stabilizes the molecule more. For a Morse oscillator, this corresponds to a field with a negative sign.

    Parameters
    ----------
    De : scalar 
        The depth energy of the Morse potential in SI units (Joules)
    omega0 : scalar
        the fundamental vibrational frequency parameter in Hz; equal to (kappa_e/mu)^(1/2) where mu is the reduced mass.
    kappa_e : scalar
        the force constant in N/m; the curvature at the bottom of the potential well.
    charge : scalar
        the charge on the positively-charged atom in the dipole, in Coulombs
    field : scalar
        the applied electric field, in Volts/meter
    n_basis : scalar, int
        the number of rows/columns in the H matrix to be computed

    Returns
    -------
    H : array-like (nbasis, nbasis)
         Matrix elements H_mn = <m | H(F=0) + charge*field(u-r_e) | n> for the Morse Oscillator in units of Joules
