# **What is the complex conjugate of** 
# $$ 
# \Psi(x,t) = A e^{(a+bi)(kx - \omega t)} 
# $$

# The complex conjugate is obtained by replacing $i$ with $-i$. So
# 
# $$ \Psi^*(x,t) = A e^{(a-bi)(kx - \omega t)} $$
# 
# I would accept an answer where it was not assumed that the constants in the expression were real, e.g.,
# 
# $$ \Psi^*(x,t) = A^* e^{(a^*-b^*i)(k^*x - \omega^* t)} $$
