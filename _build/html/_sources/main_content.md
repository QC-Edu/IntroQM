# Quantum Chemistry

> **CHEM 3PA3** *Quantum Mechanics and Spectroscopy.* An introduction to quantum chemistry and its applications in spectroscopy and structure and unusual phenomena at the nanoscale. 

## Administrative Documents

- [Syllabus](documents/syllabus.pdf)
- Course Introduction [video](), [transcript](), and [slides]().

## [Learning Objectives](documents/objectives.md)

- Know, understand, and use the key equations of quantum mechanics for chemical applications
- Understand and apply the key concepts of quantum chemistry.
- Read, write, and use common quantum chemical notation.
- Know the ground-state wavefunctions, eigenenergies, quantum numbers, and selection rules for important exactly-solvable Hamiltonians. Be able to use these systems to (approximately) model real atomic and molecular systems.
- Know, understand, and apply quantum concepts to atoms & molecules.
- Know, understand, and apply approximate computational strategies and their associated practical computational methods

## Assessment

Your assignments will be turned in using [Github Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/). To learn more about Github Classroom, see our [tutorial](ipynb/tutorial_1.ipynb) and GitHub's [video](https://githubuniverse.com/content-library/github-classroom-101/). Each assignment will be assessed both on GitHub (for correctness and quality) and through an interview (for depth of understanding). Your exam will have the same format as the assignments.

## Extra Credit

Extra points may be earned by making pull requests to [this repository](https://github.com/QC-Edu/IntroQM2022). The aim is to encourage you to contribute/refine content that benefits other students. While all contributions are encouraged, if you wish to ensure that extra credit will be granted, ask for prior approval/guidance from the instructor. [More information is available here.](extracredit/overview.md). Contributors to the repository are expected to abide by the [code of conduct of the QC-Devs organization](https://qcdevs.org/guidelines/). 

## Other resources

From the vast amount of other material available on the internet, I've curated a [selection](documents/refs.md). Materials from a previous version of the course are available at [qchem1.qcdevs.org](https://qchem1.qcdevs.org/).

## [Code of Conduct](https://qcdevs.org/guidelines/QCDevsCodeOfConduct/)

Treat others with respect, kindness, and empathy; assume they're doing the same. Communicate clearly. Be helpful. Be open. Be nice. If someone says stop; stop.
