    "The potential energy of a diatomic molecule goes to infinity at short internuclear separation ($u \\rightarrow 0$) because of the nuclear-nuclear repulsion and approaches a constant (which we typically define to be zero) at infinite internuclear distance. In between these limits, there is typically a minimum at $r_e$, which represents the equilibrium bond length for the molecule (in the absence of quantum effects). If we assume that the atomic nuclei, which are much more massive than electrons, have relatively small De Broglie wavelength and do not deviate far from $u = r_e$, it is reasonable to expand the potential energy in a Taylor series about that point,\n",

The term $V(r_e)$ only shifts the total energy of the system up or down by a constant, so we can *choose* to set the zero of the energy scale so that $V(r_e) = 0$.
