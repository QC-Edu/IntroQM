# Quantum Chemistry

> **CHEM 3PA3** *Quantum Mechanics and Spectroscopy.* An introduction to quantum chemistry and its applications in spectroscopy and structure and unusual phenomena at the nanoscale. The main course content is conveyed through, and assessed by, Jupyter notebooks, and uses the JupyterBook toolbox. GitHub Classroom is used for assessments.

## Overview

- [**Syllabus**](https://github.com/QC-Edu/IntroQM2022/blob/master/documents/syllabus.pdf?raw=true)
- **Course Introduction** [video]() and [slides](presentations/intro.pdf?raw=true).
- [**Marking Scheme**](presentations/introQM?raw=true)
- [**Learning Objectives:**](documents/objectives.md)
  - Know, understand, and use the key equations of quantum mechanics for chemical applications
  - Understand and apply the key concepts of quantum chemistry.
  - Read, write, and use common quantum chemical notation.
  - Know the ground-state wavefunctions, eigenenergies, quantum numbers, and selection rules for important exactly-solvable Hamiltonians. Be able to use these systems to (approximately) model real atomic and molecular systems.
  - Know, understand, and apply quantum concepts to atoms & molecules.
  - Know, understand, and apply approximate computational strategies and their associated practical computational methods

## Assessment
- **Assignments** will be turned in using [Github Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/). To learn more about Github Classroom, see our [tutorial](ipynb/Tutorial_0.ipynb) and GitHub's [video](https://githubuniverse.com/content-library/github-classroom-101/). Each assignment will be assessed both on GitHub (for correctness and quality) and through an interview (for depth of understanding). *Your exam will have the same format as the assignments.*
- **Extra Points** may be earned by [making pull requests](contributing.md) to [this repository](https://github.com/QC-Edu/IntroQM2022). The aim is to encourage you to contribute/refine content that benefits other students. While all contributions are encouraged, if you wish to ensure that extra credit will be granted, ask for prior approval/guidance from the instructor.
