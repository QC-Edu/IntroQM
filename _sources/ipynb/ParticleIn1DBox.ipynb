    "Cyanine dye molecules are often modelled as one-dimension particles in a box. To understand why, start by thinking classically.  You learn in organic chemistry that electrons can more “freely” along alternating double bonds.  If this is true, then you can imagine that the electrons can more from one Nitrogen to the other, almost without resistance.  On the other hand, there are sp<sup>3</sup>-hybridized functional groups attached to the Nitrogen atom, so once the electron gets to Nitrogen atom, it has to turn around and go back whence it came.   A very, very, very simple model would be to imagine that the electron is totally free between the Nitrogen atoms, and totally forbidden from going much beyond the Nitrogen atoms.  This suggests modeling these systems a potential energy function like:\n",

    "> *Note:* In fact there are several different equivalent definitions of the kinetic energy density, but this is not very important in an introductory quantum chemistry course. All of the kinetic energy densities give the same total kinetic energy. However, because the kinetic energy density, $\\tau(x)$, represents the kinetic energy of a particle at the point $x$, and it is impossible to know the momentum (or the momentum-squared, ergo the kinetic energy) exactly at a given point in space according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle), there can be no unique definition for $\\tau(x)$."
