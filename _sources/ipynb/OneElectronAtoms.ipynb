    "Just as the touchstone of chemistry is the periodic table, the touchstone of quantum chemistry is the atomic wavefunction. As we shall see, our intuition about many-electron atoms is built up from our knowledge of 1-electron atoms, mainly because many-electron atoms are mathematically intractable, while 1-electron atoms are not appreciably more complicated than an electron confined to a spherical ball. A detailed mathematical exposition on 1-electron atoms--which are often called hydrogenic atoms--is provided as a [pdf](https://github.com/PaulWAyers/IntroQChem/blob/main/documents/Hatom.pdf?raw=true). This is only a brief summary."
