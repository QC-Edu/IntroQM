# Extra Credit Problems for Jupyter, Python, Numpy, etc.

You can complete additional courses on LinkedIn Learning or other venues for additional points. The below links are curated to be especially helpful and useful, but almost any online activity that you complete and can document the completion of is acceptable. To get credit, add to the list of courses you have completed in your `Course-Certificates` GitHub repository. You can add courses anytime before the end of the term, but be sure that you get your points, as I might not check your repository unless you tell me to do so.

## [Codecademy Python 2](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python)

- This is Python 2, but Python 3 isn't very different, and the Python 3 course requires a (paid) subscription to Codecademy, while the Python 2 course does not. (You can get a free trial from Codecademy, though.) To do this assignment, sign up for Codecademy (free) and work through the 12 topical modules by reading about Python syntax and solving the interactive web-based exercises on your own. If you get stuck, you'll be provided with instructive hints. This [course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) will take *much* less than the time they estimate, because you can skip projects and quizzes that are accessible only through a (paid) PRO account. When you're finished, take a screenshot of the certificate of completion add it to the list of certificates in your `Course-Certificates` repository. See image below.

## [The Coder's Apprentice](https://dodona.ugent.be/en/courses/296/)
- This seems like a great course introducing Python 3, with lots of hands-on exercises! It's quite substantial. When you register, you should have access to the online score sheet, which you can submit for extra credit.

## Linkedin Learning

You can complete relevant LinkedIn Learning courses to earn extra points. For example, you can choose to complete some of the courses you've already (partly) seen in the course material. Simply add the LinkedIn Learning certificate of completion to the list in your `Course-Certificates` repository.

- [Programming Foundations: Fundamentals](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/programming-foundations-fundamentals-3?u=56982905). Other courses in the "programming foundations" series are also acceptable. The courses [beyond fundamentals](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/programming-foundations-beyond-the-fundamentals?u=56982905) and [numerical mathematics](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/programming-foundations-numerical-mathematics-and-calculations?u=56982905) are especially relevant.
