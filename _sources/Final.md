# Final Exam Format

You are expected to complete the GitHub Classroom exercises, and then defend your exam, in person, in ABB-264. [Use my bookable schedule to sign up for a time slot](https://meet.boomerangapp.com/ayersp.gmail.com/meeting2). If no time slot works for you, let me know. Based on the poll, the exam is on April 23.

**Your final exam notebooks must be submitted with GitHub Classroom by noon on April 22.** This will give Rick and me time to review it before we meet.

Your final exam has **three parts**. These contributions are added to the [overall marking scheme](documents/markingscheme.md). 

*You are allowed to "drop" one "unsuccessful" exam component.* I recommend saving that privilege in case one of the discussion questions is too challenging, but you can choose to not complete any one of the eight parts of the final exam. 

## Knowledge Tests (~5 minutes)
There are three knowledge tests. They are graded Successful/Unsuccessful. We will discuss one question per test, and you must demonstrate understanding of your answer to be judged successful on this part of the exam. See the following GitHub Classroom Links. The first one has a "bonus" for +1 point (because I accidentally made one extra question).

## Jupyter Notebooks (~5 minutes)
There are two Jupyter notebooks. They are graded Successful/Unsuccessful. There are "extra points" available. We will discuss one segment of each notebook.

## Discussion (~10 minutes)
From the [list of questions from the tutorials](linkedFiles/Questions.ipynb), you will have three randomly selected questions, which are graded Successful/Unsuccessful, with +/- 1 depending on the quality of your answer. These will be graded somewhat more rigorously than during the course sessions, since *every* question has previously been disseminated and discussed.  
- barely adequate (S-)
- acceptable (S)
- exemplary (S+)
