Keys to assignments are not always available. But where available, instructors can join the (private) GitHub with the answer keys by e-mailing Paul Ayers, <ayers@mcmaster.ca>, from your official e-mail account. Where possible, `nbgrader` can be used to mark assignments. New contributions to the problem bank are most welcome too!
