# Quantum Chemistry

> *Quantum Mechanics and Spectroscopy.* An introduction to quantum chemistry and its applications in spectroscopy and structure and unusual phenomena at the nanoscale. The main course content is conveyed through, and assessed by, Jupyter notebooks, and uses the JupyterBook toolbox. GitHub Classroom is used for assessment.

## Overview

- **Course Introduction** [video](https://www.macvideo.ca/media/Welcome+to+CHEM+3PA3/1_5uetc04h) and [slides](https://github.com/QC-Edu/IntroQM/blob/master/presentations/0_IntroVideo.pdf?raw=true).

- [**Learning Objectives:**](documents/objectives.md)
  - Know, understand, and use the key equations of quantum mechanics for chemical applications
  - Understand and apply the key concepts of quantum chemistry.
  - Read, write, and use common quantum chemical notation.
  - Know the ground-state wavefunctions, eigenenergies, quantum numbers, and selection rules for important exactly-solvable Hamiltonians. Be able to use these systems to (approximately) model real atomic and molecular systems.
  - Know, understand, and apply quantum concepts to atoms & molecules.
  - Know, understand, and apply approximate computational strategies and their associated practical computational methods

## Assessment
- **Assignments** are provided via [Github Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/). To learn more about Github Classroom, see our [tutorial](problems/Tutorial_0.ipynb). Each assignment is graded automatically on GitHub (for correctness and quality)
- **Extra Points** may be earned by [making pull requests](contributing.md) to [this repository](https://github.com/QC-Edu/IntroQM). The aim is to encourage you to contribute/refine content that benefits other students. While all contributions ar   e encouraged, if you wish to ensure that extra credit will be granted, ask for prior approval/guidance from the instructor. [More information is available here.](extracredit/overview.md) Points are earned commensurate with the contribution, so even something as simple as correcting a typographical error in a notebook will receive some reward. 
- **Auditing** the course is allowed. This course was designed to help self-motivated independent learners. GitHub classroom assignments should be accessible, and auto-graded, without issue. Personal support is, unfortunately but necessarily, much more limited.
