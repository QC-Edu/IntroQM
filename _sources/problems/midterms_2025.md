## &#x2753; Questions about Solving the Schr&ouml;dinger Equation.

1. Consider the hydrogen molecule ion, $\text{H}_2^+$. Is it more sensible to use the secular equation (basis-set-expansion) or perturbation theory? What if the bond length is very small? What if the bond length is very large?
1. How is the Hellmann-Feynman theorem related to perturbation theory?
1. What is perturbation theory? What is the expression for the first-order perturbed wavefunction?
1. What is the Hamiltonian for the one-electron atom? What are the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the one-electron atom?


## &#x2753; Questions about Electronic Systems.
1. Suppose electrons did not repel each other. Can you write the wavefunction for a many-electron atom in that case?
1. Why do you think solving the Schrödinger equation for the one-electron molecule is more complicated than solving the Schrödinger equation for the one-electron atom?
1. For what atomic number, $Z$, is the energy of a one-electron atom comparable to the rest-mass energy of an electron, $m_e c^2$? For atomic numbers close to this value, relativistic effects become extremely important.
1. What are eigenfunctions for the $n=l+1$ state of a one-electron atom?
1. Show that if you minimize the energy as a function of the basis-set coefficients using the variational principle, then you obtain the secular equation.
1. The Hellmann-Feynman theorem indicates that given the ground-state wavefunction for a molecule, the force on the nuclei can be obtained. Explain how.
1. What does it mean that perturbation theory is inaccurate when the perturbation is large?
1. Can you explain why the energy goes down when the electron-in-a-box is placed in an external electric field? (Assume that the point where the potential is defined to be zero is in the center of the box, so that the _average_ potential is not changing.)
1. For a sufficiently-highly excited state, the effect of an external electric field is negligible. Why is this true intuitively? Can you show it graphically? Can you explain it mathematically?
1. If a uniform external electric field of magnitude $F$ in the $\hat{\mathbf{u}} = [\hat{u}_x,\hat{u}_y,\hat{u}_z]^T$ direction is applied to a particle with charge $q$, the potential $V(x,y,z) = -qF(u_x x + u_y y + u_z z)$ is added to the Hamiltonian. (This follows from the fact that the force applied to the particles is proportional to the electric field, $\text{force} = q \vec{E} = q F \hat{\mathbf{u}}$ and the force is $\text{force} = - \nabla V(x,y,z)$. If the field is weak, then perturbation theory can be used, and the energy can be written as a Taylor series. The coefficients of the Taylor series give the dipole moment ($\mu$), dipole polarizability ($\alpha$), first dipole hyperpolarizability ($\beta$), second dipole hyperpolarizability ($\gamma$) in the $\hat{\mathbf{u}}$ direction.
   - The dipole moment, $\mu$, of any spherical system is zero. Explain why.
   - The polarizability, $\alpha$, of any system is always positive. Explain why.

$$
\begin{align}
E_k(F) &= E_k(0) + F \left[\frac{dE_k}{d F} \right]_{F=0}
+ \frac{F^2}{2!} \left[\frac{d^2E_k}{d F^2} \right]_{F=0}
+ \frac{F^3}{3!} \left[\frac{d^3E_k}{d F^3} \right]_{F=0}
+ \frac{F^4}{4!} \left[\frac{d^4E_k}{d F^4} \right]_{F=0} + \cdots \\
&= E_k(0) - F \mu_{F=0}
- \frac{F^2}{2!} \alpha_{F=0}
- \frac{F^3}{3!} \beta_{F=0}
- \frac{F^4}{4!} \gamma_{F=0} + \cdots \\
\end{align}
$$

## &#x2753; Questions about Many-Electron Systems and their Approximation.

1. What are bosons? What are fermions? How do the wavefunctions differ?
1. What is the fundamental assumption that underlies the orbital approximation?
1. What is a Slater determinant?
1. What is the fundamental idea behind Hartree-Fock theory?
1. How does one use the secular equation to approximate the wavefunction for a many-electron system?
1. Explain what the Hartree-Fock approximation has to do with the concept of effective nuclear charge.
1. Can you think of a system where a single Slater determinant would be an extremely poor approximation?
1. To what extent is the shape of the spherical harmonic intuitive, especially the doughnut shapes associated with an electron's angular momentum around the z axis.
1. Derive the Rydberg formula.
1. Can you derive a Rydberg-like formula for the wavenumber of excitations for a particle-in-a-box? How would this formula become more complicated for particles-in-a-box in higher dimensions?
1. An [advanced](https://www.weimer.itp.uni-hannover.de/fileadmin/weimer-group/qdt.pdf) (and approximate) version of the [Rydberg formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rydberg_state) holds for highly-excited states of most atoms and molecules, and is particularly accurate for excitations from the highest occupied ($ns$ orbital) of [alkali metal atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rydberg_atom). The basic idea is that the excitation energy can be expressed as a formula like the below, where the [quantum defect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_defect), $\delta_{l}$, [depends on the orbital angular momentum of the state](https://www.weimer.itp.uni-hannover.de/fileadmin/weimer-group/qdt.pdf). Can you understand where the below formula for the excitation energy comes from? Why does the quantum defect depend on angular momentum? Why does the quantum defect decrease as the angular momentum of the state? (For example, for Rubidium, $\delta_0 = 3.13$ but $\delta_2 = 1.35$.) Why does the quantum defect increase for heavier alkali metal atoms? (For example, for Li, $\delta_0 = 0.41$ but for Cs, $\delta_0 = 4.13$.)
   $$
   \Delta E_{ns \rightarrow n'l'} \approx \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{(n-\delta_0)^2}-\frac{1}{(n'-\delta_{l'})^2}\right)
   $$
1. For conjugated linear molecules like the cyanine dyes, the $\pi$-electrons are really confined to a 3-dimensional region, but the size of the region that is perpendicular to the conjugation is much smaller. For example, one could consider a 3-dimensional box or a 3-dimension cylinder:
   $$
   \hat{H}_{\text{p-in-3d-box}} = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V_{a_x}(x) + V_{a_y}(y) + V_{a_z}(z)
   $$
   $$
   \hat{H}_{\text{p-in-cylinder}} = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V_{a_z}(z) + V_{a_r}(r)
   $$
   $$
   V_a(x) =
   \begin{cases}
       +\infty & x\leq 0\\
       0       & 0\lt x \lt a\\
       +\infty & a \leq x
   \end{cases}
   $$

- What are the eigenfunctions and eigenenergies for these systems?
- Why is the one-dimensional particle-in-a-box model sufficient for describing the _spectroscopy_ of cyanine dyes?
