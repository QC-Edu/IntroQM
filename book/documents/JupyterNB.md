# Using Jupyter Notebooks

There are several ways to edit a Jupyter notebook (an `.ipynb` file).
1. Using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). **Recommended!**
1. Using [Binder](https://mybinder.org/).
1. Using GitHub [Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces). Codespaces is free with an education GitHub account.
1. You can, in general, use any online Jupyter Hub (e.g. [syzygy](https://mcmaster.syzygy.ca/)). However, it can be difficult to ensure that the dependencies you need are installed. There are [lots of other ways to run Jupyter in the cloud](https://jupyter4edu.github.io/jupyter-edu-book/getting-going.html#running-jupyter-in-the-cloud).
1. You can edit Jupyter Notebooks locally. It is relatively easy to use [jupyter](https://docs.anaconda.com/ae-notebooks/user-guide/basic-tasks/apps/jupyter/index.html) through [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). One can also use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to edit [notebooks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).

We will ensure that assignments work with Google colab. We'll try to help people using other platforms too, but make no promises.
