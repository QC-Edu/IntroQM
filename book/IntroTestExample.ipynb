    "# Demonstration of GitHub Classroom Q & A\n",
    "\n",
    "## &#x1f468;&#x200d;&#x1f3eb; Purpose\n",
    "GitHub Classroom not only allows us to automatically test programming/code. Other types of questions are supported too.\n",
    "1. &#x1f3b2; Multiple-Choice Questions (one or more answers, separated by spaces or commas)\n",
    "2. &#x1fa99; True/False Questions (write True/False)\n",
    "3. &#x1F5A9; Numerical answers requiring some calculation (write the numerical answer in the requested units; significant figures are not checked)\n",
    "4. &#x1f9ee; Numerical answers requiring no calculation (usually just counting) (write the answer as a number)\n",
    "4. &#x1f500; Matching Questions (write pairs sequentially).\n",
    "\n",
    "The way we do it, it is important that you *always* put your answer in the indicated position and never use the bold-faced word \"Answer\" elsewhere. Other than that restriction, the rest of your notebook is yours to play with.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "## &#x1f4dc; Instructions\n",
    "The next few questions demonstrate the workflow. For each question type, you are first given an example; then you need to do another question of the same type on your own.\n",
    "- You can upload files to show your mathematical work; you can also type mathematics using Markdown.\n",
    "- You can use the notebook as a calculator for numerical problems; but you can also just type in your answer computed offline.\n",
    "- You may find these [sheets containing reference data and mathematical formulas/identities](https://github.com/QC-Edu/IntroQM2022/blob/master/documents/ReferenceConstantsConversionsMath.pdf) useful.\n"
