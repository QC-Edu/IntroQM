The basic idea is that the excitation energy can be expressed as a formula like the below, where the [quantum defect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_defect), $\\delta_{l}$, [depends on the orbital angular momentum of the state](https://www.weimer.itp.uni-hannover.de/fileadmin/weimer-group/qdt.pdf).
