Because one cannot specify the momentum (or its square) and position of a particle simultaneously, however, one cannot specify the kinetic energy at a point in space in quantum mechanics. [So the local kinetic energy is not well-defined in quantum mechanics](https://doi.org/10.1021/jp1029745).\n",

In practice, such ambiguities do not matter much since the most important observables are those that can be clearly defined.

Such [discussions](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comptc.2014.09.028) can be [useful](https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.201208206) in [practice]( https://doi.org/10.1002/jcc.26003), but they are contrary to the spirit of quantum mechanics (even though they are deeply entangled with the language of chemistry).
