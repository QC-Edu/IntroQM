1. Is it possible for the wavelength of the scattered photon in Compton Scattering to be infinite? (I.e., could the photon be entirely absorbed?)



1. What are the units of the wavefunction?


1. Once upon a time, one of the professors at McMaster was asked "why is the quantum-mechanical momentum operator associated with the derivative" and, unable to answer the student, sent the student to me for clarification. Can you justify why the quantum mechanical momentum operator is $\hat{p} = -i \hbar \nabla$?


1.  Once upon a time, a person interviewing for a job as a quantum chemist was asked how it was possible that the kinetic energy of a quantum system was always positive, given that the quantum-mechanical operator for the kinetic energy was "the negative of something squared", namely, $\hat{T} = \tfrac{-1}{2m}\nabla^2$. How would you answer this question?
1.  What are the eigenfunctions of the momentum operator?
1. What are the eigenfunctions of the kinetic-energy operator?
1. Is every eigenfunction of the momentum operator also an eigenfunction of the kinetic-energy operator? Is the [converse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Converse_(logic)) also true?
1. Suppose that one has an electron that is tethered to the origin by a spring, so that the force the electrons feels towards the origin, $x=0$, increases proportionally to its distance, $F = -kx$. What would the Hamiltonian be?
1. Show, mathematically, that the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a separable operator, $\hat{A}(x,y) = \hat{A}(x) + \hat{A}(y)$ are given by the above expressions.

1. How would the wavefunction and ground-state energy change if you made a small change in the particle-in-a-box Hamiltonian, so that the right-hand-side of the box was a little higher than the left-hand-side?
1. Any system with a zero-point energy of zero is classical. Why?
1. How would you compute the probability of observing an electron at the center of a box if the box contained 2 electrons? If it contained 4 electrons? If it contained 8 electrons? The probability of observing an electron at the center of a box with 3 electrons is sometimes *lower* than the probability of observing an electron at the center of a box with 2 electrons. Why?
1. Demonstrate that the kinetic energy operator is linear and Hermitian.
1. What is the lowest-energy excitation energy for the particle-in-a-box?
1. Suppose you wanted to design a one-dimensional box containing a single electron that absorbed blue light? How long would the box be?


1. Explain why separation of variables is consistent with the Born Postulate that the square-magnitude of a particle's wavefunction is the probability distribution function for the particle.
1. What is the expression for the zero-point energy and ground-state wavefunction of an electron in a 4-dimensional box? Can you identify some states of the 4-dimensional box with especially high degeneracy?
1. What is the degeneracy of the k-th excited state of a particle confined to a circular disk? What is the degeneracy of the k-th excited state of a particle confined in a spherical ball?

1. How would you write the Hamiltonian for two electrons confined to a box? Could you solve this system with separation of variables? Why or why not?
1. Write the time-independent Schr&ouml;dinger equation for an electron in an cylindrical box. What are its eigenfunctions and eigenvalues?
1. Construct an example of a four-fold *accidental* degeneracy for a particle in a 2-dimensional rectangular (not square!) box.
1. If there is any degenerate state (either accidental or due to symmetry) for the multi-dimensional particle-in-a-box, then there are always an infinite number of other degenerate states. Why?

1. What is an example of a classical observable that is not a quantum-mechanical observable?
1. Give an example of two quantum-mechanical operators that commute. What about two operators that don't commute?
