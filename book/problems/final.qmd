\hat{H}_5(\mathbf{R}_B) &=  -\tfrac{1}{2} \nabla_{\mathbf{r}}^2 - \tfrac{Z_A}{r} - \tfrac{Z_B}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{R}_B|} \\
\hat{H}_6 &= -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2}{dx^2} -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2}{dy^2} -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2}{dz^2} + V_{a_z}(z) + V_{a_r}(\sqrt{x^2+y^2}) \\
\hat{H}_7 &= -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 +\frac{a}{r^2} - \frac{b}{r}
\end{align}
$$

    +\infty & x\leq 0\\

    +\infty & a \leq x
\end{cases}

## &#x2753; Questions about Electronic Systems.
78. What is the Hamiltonian for a many-electron molecule? How would you (approximately) solve the associated Schrödinger equation?
1. What is the electronic Hamiltonian for a many-electron molecule? How would you (approximately) solve the associated Schrödinger equation?
1. What is the nuclear Hamiltonian for a many-electron molecule? How would you (approximately) solve the associated Schrödinger equation?

1. For what atomic number, $Z$, is the energy of a one-electron atom comparable to the rest-mass energy of an electron, $m_e c^2$? For atomic numbers close to this value, relativistic effects become extremely important.
1. What are eigenfunctions for the $n=l+1$ state of a one-electron atom?

1. The Hellmann-Feynman theorem indicates that given the ground-state wavefunction for a molecule, the force on the nuclei can be obtained. Explain how.
1. What does it mean that perturbation theory is inaccurate when the perturbation is large?
1. Can you explain why the energy goes down when the electron-in-a-box is placed in an external electric field? (Assume that the point where the potential is defined to be zero is in the center of the box, so that the _average_ potential is not changing.)
1. For a sufficiently-highly excited state, the effect of an external electric field is negligible. Why is this true intuitively? Can you show it graphically? Can you explain it mathematically?
1. If a uniform external electric field of magnitude $F$ in the $\hat{\mathbf{u}} = [\hat{u}_x,\hat{u}_y,\hat{u}_z]^T$ direction is applied to a particle with charge $q$, the potential $V(x,y,z) = -qF(u_x x + u_y y + u_z z)$ is added to the Hamiltonian. (This follows from the fact that the force applied to the particles is proportional to the electric field, $\text{force} = q \vec{E} = q F \hat{\mathbf{u}}$ and the force is $\text{force} = - \nabla V(x,y,z)$. If the field is weak, then perturbation theory can be used, and the energy can be written as a Taylor series. The coefficients of the Taylor series give the dipole moment ($\mu$), dipole polarizability ($\alpha$), first dipole hyperpolarizability ($\beta$), second dipole hyperpolarizability ($\gamma$) in the $\hat{\mathbf{u}}$ direction.
   - The dipole moment, $\mu$, of any spherical system is zero. Explain why.
   - The polarizability, $\alpha$, of any system is always positive. Explain why.

\begin{align}
E_k(F) &= E_k(0) + F \left[\frac{dE_k}{d F} \right]_{F=0}
+ \frac{F^2}{2!} \left[\frac{d^2E_k}{d F^2} \right]_{F=0}
+ \frac{F^3}{3!} \left[\frac{d^3E_k}{d F^3} \right]_{F=0}
+ \frac{F^4}{4!} \left[\frac{d^4E_k}{d F^4} \right]_{F=0} + \cdots \\
&= E_k(0) - F \mu_{F=0}
- \frac{F^2}{2!} \alpha_{F=0}
- \frac{F^3}{3!} \beta_{F=0}
- \frac{F^4}{4!} \gamma_{F=0} + \cdots \\
\end{align}

1. Can you think of a system where a single Slater determinant would be an extremely poor approximation?

1. To what extent is the shape of the spherical harmonic intuitive, especially the doughnut shapes associated with an electron's angular momentum around the z axis.

1. Derive the Rydberg formula.

1. Can you derive a Rydberg-like formula for the wavenumber of excitations for a particle-in-a-box? How would this formula become more complicated for particles-in-a-box in higher dimensions?

1. An [advanced](https://www.weimer.itp.uni-hannover.de/fileadmin/weimer-group/qdt.pdf) (and approximate) version of the [Rydberg formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rydberg_state) holds for highly-excited states of most atoms and molecules, and is particularly accurate for excitations from the highest occupied ($ns$ orbital) of [alkali metal atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rydberg_atom). The basic idea is that the excitation energy can be expressed as a formula like the below, where the [quantum defect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_defect), $\delta_{l}$, [depends on the orbital angular momentum of the state](https://www.weimer.itp.uni-hannover.de/fileadmin/weimer-group/qdt.pdf). Can you understand where the below formula for the excitation energy comes from? Why does the quantum defect depend on angular momentum? Why does the quantum defect decrease as the angular momentum of the state? (For example, for Rubidium, $\delta_0 = 3.13$ but $\delta_2 = 1.35$.) Why does the quantum defect increase for heavier alkali metal atoms? (For example, for Li, $\delta_0 = 0.41$ but for Cs, $\delta_0 = 4.13$.)
   $$
   \Delta E_{ns \rightarrow n'l'} \approx \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{(n-\delta_0)^2}-\frac{1}{(n'-\delta_{l'})^2}\right)
   $$

1. The Coulomb potential governing interparticle attraction/repulsion between two particles, with charges $q_m$ and $q_n$ and positions $\mathbf{r}_m$ and $\mathbf{r}_n$ in a d-dimensional system is given below. Note that these expressions are _not_ the usual inverse power of the distance. Nonetheless, when considering systems like the cyanine dyes or 2-dimensional quantum dots, we usually use the 3-dimensional Coulomb potential. Why?
   $$
   V_{\text{Coulomb}} =
   \begin{cases}
   (q_m q_n) \left|\mathbf{r}_m - \mathbf{r}_n \right|^{2-d} & d> 0 \text{ and } d \ne 2 \\
   (q_m q_n)\ln\left|\mathbf{r}_m - \mathbf{r}_n \right|  & d = 2
   \end{cases}
   $$

1. For conjugated linear molecules like the cyanine dyes, the $\pi$-electrons are really confined to a 3-dimensional region, but the size of the region that is perpendicular to the conjugation is much smaller. For example, one could consider a 3-dimensional box or a 3-dimension cylinder:
   $$
   \hat{H}_{\text{p-in-3d-box}} = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V_{a_x}(x) + V_{a_y}(y) + V_{a_z}(z)
   $$
   $$
   \hat{H}_{\text{p-in-cylinder}} = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V_{a_z}(z) + V_{a_r}(r)
   $$
   $$
   V_a(x) =
   \begin{cases}
       +\infty & x\leq 0\\
       0       & 0\lt x \lt a\\
       +\infty & a \leq x
   \end{cases}
   $$

- What are the eigenfunctions and eigenenergies for these systems?
- Why is the one-dimensional particle-in-a-box model sufficient for describing the _spectroscopy_ of cyanine dyes? How long does the chain need to be (e.g., for what value of $k$) before the non-one-dimensionality of the box becomes important? You can assume the following (reasonable-ish) values for the parameters:

$$
\begin{align}
a_x &= a_y = 2 \cdot 10^{-10} \text{ m} \\
a_r &= 1 \cdot 10^{-10} \text{ m} \\
a_z &= \left(5.67 + 2.49 (k + 1)\right) \cdot 10^{-10} \text{ m} = \left(10.71 + 4.71 (k + 1)\right)\text{ a.u.}
\end{align}
$$
