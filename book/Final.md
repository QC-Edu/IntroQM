# Final Exam Format

You are expected to complete the GitHub Classroom exercises, and then defend your exam, in person, in ABB-264. Sign up for a time slot here.

Your final exam has **three parts** and each piece has *three pieces*. These contributions are added to the [overall marking scheme](documents/markingscheme.md). 

*You are allowed to "drop" one "unsuccessful" exam component.* I recommend saving that privilege in case one of the discussion questions is too challenging, but you can choose to not complete any one of the nine parts of the final exam. 

## Knowledge Tests (~5 minutes)
There are three knowledge tests. They are graded Successful/Unsuccessful. We will discuss one question per test, and you must demonstrate understanding of your answer to be judged successful on this part of the exam. See the following GitHub Classroom Links.

## Jupyter Notebooks (~5 minutes)
There are three Jupyter notebooks. They are graded Sucessful/Unsuccessful. There are "extra points" available. We will discuss one segment of each notebook. 

## Discussion (~10 minutes)
From the [list of questions from the tutorials](linkedFiles/Questions.ipynb), you will have three randomly selected questions, which are graded Successful/Unsuccessful, with +/- 1 depending on the quality of your answer:  
- barely adequate (S-)
- acceptable (S)
- exemplary (S+)
