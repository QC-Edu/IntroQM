    "### The Hamiltonian\n",
    "An equation like Schr&ouml;dinger’s may seem mysterious to us now, but at the time it was derived it seemed very natural. A top-rate physicist like Schr&ouml;dinger had a rich background in classical physics, and he would have understood that there were many results, from classical physics, that suggested that the equations for radiation and for matter could be combined.  One of the strongest such suggestions came from two principles: “Fermat’s principle of least time” and the “Hamilton-Lagrange principle of least action.” Fermat’s principle says that a ray of light goes from point A to point B in the fastest possible way, and can be used to derive all of classical optics. The Hamilton-Lagrange principle says that a particle goes from point A to point B in a way that makes minimizes its action (the product of its momentum and its change in position) along the path. Schr&ouml;dinger would have noticed that Planck’s constant had units of action, and then quickly ascertained that laws of quantum mechanics might be governed by an equation similar to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the action, \n",
