Question 1 is a matching question.  Like, there are two columns and you match the operators for the corresponding formula.  Don't know how to transcribe this.

Calculate the wavelength for the spectral line that arises from an n = 6 to n = 3 transition in the hydrogen atom.
ANS: 1094.12 nm
872.94 nm
744.43 nm
438.89 nm
273.50 nm

For the hydrogen atom ground state, what is the probability of finding the electron in the classically forbidden region (i.e., where E < V)?
ANS: 0.2381
0.1191
0.1587
0.07937
0.2976

The positron has charge +e and mass equal to the electron mass.  What is the ground-state energy of a positronium -- an "atom" consisting of a positron and an electron?
ANS: -6.8 eV
-13.6 eV
-3.4 eV
9.6 eV

What is the radius of the sphere defining the 1s hydrogen orbital?  The radius is defined here as the radius inside which the electron has a 95% probability of being found.
ANS: 1.67 Angstroms
NOTE: this will not be multiple choice, they will use a solver for this.
