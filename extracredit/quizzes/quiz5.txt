For a diatomic harmonic oscillator, as the vibrational level v increases, the separation between the energies also increases.
False

The infrared spectrum of 1H79Br consists of an intense line at $2648.97 cm^{-1}$.  What is the force constant of 1H79Br?
NOTE: Paul, note the isotope super/subscripts I couldn't denote here. Fix these. Sorry :(
ANS: 415.5 N/m
514.5 N/m
451.5 N/m
545.1 N/m

The infrared spectrum of a sample of HCl, composed only of one particular isotope of hydrogen and chlorine, consists of an intense line at $2075.14 cm^{-1}$.  The force constant of HCl is 480N/m.  Assuming the validity of the diatomic harmonic oscillator approximation, which isotopes of hydrogen and chlorine are in the sample?
NOTE: Paul, note the super/subscripts I couldn't denote here. Fix these.  Sorry :(
ANS: 2H, 35Cl
1H, 35Cl
1H, 37Cl
2H, 37Cl

Can't make isotopes in plaintext....

The dissociation energy for 79Br81Br in its ground state is experimentally observed at $15896 cm^{-1}$.  The infrared spectrum of 79Br81Br consists of an intense line at $319 cm^{-1}$.  Using the diatomic harmonic oscillator approximation, what is the energy difference between the minimum of the potential well and the dissociation limit?
NOTE: Again the isotopes need super/subscripts.
ANS: 1.991 eV
1.971 eV
2.011 eV
1.951 eV

The Hermite polynomials, $H_{v}(ξ)$, are even if $v$ is even, and odd if $v$ is odd.
True

Which of these harmonic oscillator wavefunctions is NOT normalized? Note: use $\alpha = {(k/\mu)^{1/2}}/h$
ANS: $\psi_1\left(x\right)= \left(\frac{\alpha^3}{2\pi}\right)^{1/4} x e^{-\alpha x^2 / 2}$
